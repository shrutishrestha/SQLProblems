Write a query that returns the user ID of all users that have created at least one ‘Refinance’ submission and at least one ‘InSchool’ submission.
Difficulty:Easy

### Table example:

| id | user_id | type      |
| 1  |    2    | Refinance |
| 2  |    2    | Refinance |
| 2  |    2    | InSchool  |


### Solution:

#### objective:
- find user ID have both `Refinance` and `InSchool` submission

#### assumption:
- not all user may have that

#### logic:
- filter user WHERE type = 'refinance' and 'inschool'
- after filter, group user id and if distinct type = 2
- then we have answer



MySQL
```
select user_id from loans
where type='Refinance' OR type='inSchool'
GROUP BY user_id
having count(distinct type)=2;
```

PostgreSQL
```
select user_id 
from loans
where type='Refinance' 
INTERSECT 
select user_id
from loans
where type='InSchool';
```
