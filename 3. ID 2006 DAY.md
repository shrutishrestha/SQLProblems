Return a distribution of users activity per day of the month. By distribution we mean the number of posts per day of the month.

| post_id | poster | post_text | post_keywords | post_date |
|----|----|----|----|----|
|1|asd|asd|[a,b]|2010-01-09|

logic:
- Get the day first from the yyyy-mm-dd format
- this question means get daily not like 01-09(date and month combined)
```
select DAY(post_date) as day_value, count(post_id)
from facebook_posts
group by DAY(post_date)
```
