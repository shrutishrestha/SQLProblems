How many customers placed an order and what is the average order amount?

| id	| customer_id	| courier_id	| seller_id	| order_timestamp_utc	| amount | city_id | 
| 1	| 102	| 224	| 79	| 2019-03-11 | 23:27:00	| 155.73	| 47 | 

Note: average amount of total customers
logic:
- get count of distinct customer and average of all amounts
```
select count(distinct customer_id), avg(amount)
from postmates_orders
```
