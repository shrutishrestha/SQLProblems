### Paid Users In April 2020

How many paid users had any calls in Apr 2020?
tables: rc_calls

| user_id	| date	| call_id |
|---|---|--|
| 1 | 2020-04-09 12:05:00 | 3 | 

tables: rc_users

| user_id	| status	| company_id |
|---|---|--|
| 1 | paid | 2 | 

logic:
- need to join as user status and data are in 2 different tables (also can do subquery)
- get month, get year compare

```
select count(distinct rcc.user_id)
from rc_calls as rcc inner join rc_users as rcu 
on rcc.user_id = rcu.user_id
where rcu.status="paid" and MONTH(rcc.date)=04 and YEAR(rcc.date)=2020

```
