Number of Comments Per User in 30 days before 2020-02-10

| user_id | created_at | number_of_comments |
|----------|----------|----------|
|   18    | 2018-12-29 | 1 |
|   18    | 2018-01-29 | 2 |

```
SELECT user_id, sum(number_of_comments) as comments_sum
from fb_comments_count
where created_at BETWEEN '2020-01-11' and '2020-02-10'
group by user_id
having comments_sum > 0  
```
Instead of counting jan has how many days and applying condition to fall exactly in between 30 days, use keyword date sub and interval keywords. (The DATE_SUB() function subtracts a time/date interval from a date and then returns the date.)

Logic:
- 30 days interval -> need to use between, 30 days given, so have to use interval
- is user specific i.e. total comment of a user -> so need to group by
- condition is user must have comments -> use having
```
SELECT user_id, sum(number_of_comments) as comments_sum
from fb_comments_count
where created_at BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2020-02-10', INTERVAL 30 DAY) and '2020-02-10'
group by user_id
having comments_sum > 0  
```
