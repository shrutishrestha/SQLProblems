Calculate the average session duration for each session type?

| user_id	| session_start	| session_end	| session_id	| session_type | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 2020-08-11 | 05:14:31	| 2021-09-11 | 09:54:5	| 539	| streamer | 

logic:
- need to group by session
- need to get average in seconds


```
select session_type, avg(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, session_start, session_end)) as time_difference
from twitch_sessions
group by session_type
```
