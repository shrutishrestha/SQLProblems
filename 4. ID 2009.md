Users With Two Statuses

| user_id	| session_start |	session_end	| session_id |	session_type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1|2020-01-20 05:11:7|2020-01-20 05:12:7|1| streamer|
|1|2020-01-20 05:15:7|2020-01-20 05:16:7|1| viewer|



logic:
- as ID 2002, first put condition on where with OR to collect all the rows which has streamer or viewer
- then group by userid and then use distinct, to make sure that both of the session types are present for a user
- and wont work because one row cant have 2 values
```
SELECT user_id
from twitch_sessions
where session_type='streamer' OR  session_type='viewer'
group by user_id
having COUNT( distinct session_type) = 2
```
